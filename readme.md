  ## Example use

    To see example use, run main.rs

  ## todo: 
    0. divide sim into modules
    1. add directors sync through sim 
    2. make sure directors can exist in one sim and perform as expected
    3. add upper and inner time for directors: time steps and ticks
    4. make more detailed vcd trace writing 
    5. come up with good visualization logger 
    6. encapsulate logger in some special wrapper so user can choose which one to use
    7. add generators to speed up structure generation
      7.1 implement fully connected generator 
      7.2 column link generator
      7.3 convolution generator
    8. add custom error type
    9. ensure operation return results instead of unsafe voids
